User Stories
## Home Page
# An area for a caption contest, which provides a randomly generated meme image and submission areas for the text. Other users can upvote (or updank) people's meme submissions, and the most votes wins and that user becomes Meme God of the day. The user also gets a certain number of dank points attributed to their meme profile.

# Below the caption contest will be an area of the most popular posts or memes from the past week.

## Caption Leaderboard Page
# A page that lists the users with the most likes (danks) on their meme from the caption of the day contest. The user will be displayed, along with a link to their meme or just the meme itself and link to their profile

## All Time Dankest Memesters Page
# A page listing the all time points leaders. Based on their 'dankness', a score generated from all time updanks and caption contest wins

# Users can view other users' profiles and posts and 'updank' submissions, which adds to that user's 'dankness'

## Profile Page
# A page displaying the user's submitted memes, their 'dankness' next to their username, and their subscribed channels. Navbar located at the top.

# User's 'dankness' is a large component of the site. It is increased based on other's activity on that user's submissions, and also on the user's overall activity throughout the app.

## Channel Page
# A display page that displays all memes of a specific type or name, e.g. 'success-kid'(the baby giving a celebratory fist pump). To search for a channel page, the user selects from a prepopulated dropdown. A user may subscribe to a channel, which adds that channel to the user's profile for reference. From their profile, or another user's profile, the user can navigate to that channel page through the link.

## Search Results Page
# A display page that displays all memes generated from a user's search (25 results, the maximum allowed for API call). These are the various channels, which have a standard meme image. User can then click a button to a submission modal where they enter the text. That meme gets added to the collection and user's profile.

##Stretch Goals:

# Users enter their location, google maps renders maps with pins of most popular meme by location

# User can submit own image which gets added to meme db with its own channel

# Create custom algorithm to display 'hot' memes based on specific activity in certain time frame

# Carousel for profile, home, results/channel pages

# Follow certain users and their activity shows up on your home page
